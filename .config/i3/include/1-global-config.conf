# workspace layouts:

workspace_layout default
#default i3 tiling mode

#workspace_layout stacking

#workspace_layout tabbed
#Tiling mode is tabbed:
#so each new window will open fullscreen as a tab, you can change between window-tabs with mouse or shortcut:
#
#    [mod]+Left focus left (left arrow key)
#    [mod]+Right focus right (right arrow key)

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.
font pango:Droid Sans Regular 8

# thin borders

# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesnâ€™t scale on retina/hidpi displays.
